 * <b>Description: </b> Look and Say Sequence
 * 
 * In mathematics, the look-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers beginning as follows:
 * 
 * 1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, 312211, 13112221, 1113213211, ... (sequence A005150 in the OEIS).
 * To generate a member of the sequence from the previous member, read off the digits 
 * of the previous member, counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit. For example:
 * 
 * 1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.
 * 11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.
 * 21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211.
 * 1211 is read off as "one 1, one 2, then two 1s" or 111221.
 * 111221 is read off as "three 1s, two 2s, then one 1" or 312211

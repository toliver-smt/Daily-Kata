 * <b>Title</b>: KataTree.java
 * <b>Project</b>: Daily-Kata
 * <b>Description: </b> This kata helps us build a tree data structure from a collection
 *  of nodes that have ids and parent ids.  This is an important structure to understand as 
 *  we will need to convert a collection of elements form a database (ids and parent ids) 
 *  and convert the data into an actual linked data structure or tree.  
 *  
 *  In this Kata, you will be receiving a collection of node objects that have the 
 *  proper linkage, but are not linked as a tree.  You must fill out the tree properly 
 *  as well as link the children and parent nodes to each other

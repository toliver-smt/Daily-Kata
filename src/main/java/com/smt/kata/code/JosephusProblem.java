 * <b>Description:</b> 
 * The Josephus problem (or Josephus permutation) is a theoretical problem related 
 * to a certain counting-out game. The problem is described as below. People 
 * are standing in a circle waiting to be executed. Counting begins at a specified 
 * point in the circle and proceeds around the circle in a specified direction. 
 * After a specified number of people are skipped, the next person is executed. 
 * The procedure is repeated with the remaining people, starting with the next 
 * person, going in the same direction and skipping the same number of people, 
 * until only one person remains, and is freed.

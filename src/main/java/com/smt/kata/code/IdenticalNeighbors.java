 * <b>Project</b>: SMT-Kata
 * <b>Description: </b> Remove Identical Neighbors
 * 
 * Write a method that takes a list and deletes any elements that are the same 
 * as an element next to them.
 * 
 * Here are some examples:
 * {1,2,1,2} → {1,2,1,2}
 * {2,1,1,2} → {2,2}
 * {2,2,1,1} → {}
 * 
 * Except at the ends, any element has two neighbors, one on either side. In this 
 * challenge, drop runs of identical neighbors.
 * 
 * Write a function RemoveIdenticalNeighbors that takes a list and outputs a modified 
 * list in which any element next to an identical element has been removed.
 * 
 * In[1]:=RemoveIdenticalNeighbors[{1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8}]
 * Out[1]={1, 3, 4, 3, 6, 7}
 * 
 * if there are an odd set of elements in a row, all are removed except one
 * In[1]:=RemoveIdenticalNeighbors[{1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8}]
 * Out[1]={1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 6, 7}
 * 
 * You may NOT use collections.  Standard java primitives/arrays only.

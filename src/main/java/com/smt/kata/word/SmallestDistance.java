 * <b>Description: </b> Smallest Distance Kata
 * Find an efficient algorithm to find the smallest distance (measured in number 
 * of words) between any two given words in a string.
 * 
 * For example, given words "hello", and "world" and a text content of 
 * "dog cat hello cat dog dog hello cat world", return 1 because there's only one 
 * word "cat" in between the two words.  As in the example above, if the first
 * word is restarted, the counter resets.

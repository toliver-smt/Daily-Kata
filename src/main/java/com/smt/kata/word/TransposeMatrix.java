 * <b>Title</b>: TransposeMatrix.java
 * <b>Project</b>: SMT-Kata
 * <b>Description: </b> Enter the Matrix
 * In this challenge, you have to obtain a sentence from the elements of a given 
 * matrix. In the matrix, each word of the sentence follows a columnar order from 
 * the top to the bottom, instead of the usual left-to-right order: 
 * it's time for transposition! 
 * 
 * Given a matrix mtx, implement a function that returns the complete sentence as 
 * a string, with the words separated by a space between them.
 * 
 * Examples
 * transposeMatrix([
 * ["I","Tesh"],
 * ["so","very"],
 *   ["love","much!"]
 * ]) ➞ "I so love Tesh very much!"
 * 
 * transposeMatrix([
 *   ["My","evolves","on"],
 *   ["world","solely","Tesha's."]
 * ]) ➞ "My world evolves solely on Tesha's."
 * 
 * transposeMatrix([
 *   ["Enter"],
 *   ["the"],
 *   ["Matrix!"]
 * ]) ➞ "Enter the Matrix!"
 * 
 * transposeMatrix([
 *   ["The","are"],
 *   ["columns","rows."]
 * ]) ➞ "The columns are rows."
 * 
 * Notes
 * All given matrices are regular, as to say that each column has the same length.
 * Punctuation is already given, you just have to add the spaces in the returned string.
